## Fractals

Fractals are mathematical objects made from simple recursive processes that produce potentially infinite identical patterns across many different scales. Many fractals appear in nature. The website <a href="http://thescienceexplorer.com/nature/8-stunning-fractals-found-nature">The Science Explorer</a> provides some examples which I have reproduced below. The package I've written allows for the production of fractal trees, both deterministic and with some added randomness in a couple domains. It also allows for gif production to make trees that sway in the wind.

#### Testing "splits" input with others set to default

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
par(mfrow=c(2,3), mar=c(1,1,1,1))
deterministic_tree(splits = 1, title = "splits = 1")
deterministic_tree(splits = 2, title = "splits = 2")
deterministic_tree(title = "default splits = 3")
deterministic_tree(splits = 4, title = "splits = 4")
deterministic_tree(splits = 5, title = "splits = 5")
deterministic_tree(splits = 6, title = "splits = 6")
```

#### Test "children" and "man_children" with others set to default
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2), mar=c(1,1,1,1))
deterministic_tree(children = 1, title = "children = 1")
deterministic_tree(title = "default children = 2")
deterministic_tree(children = 3, title = "children = 3")
deterministic_tree(children = 4, title = "children = 4")
```

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2), mar=c(1,1,1,1))
deterministic_tree(man_children = c(2,3,4), title = "man_children = c(4,3,2)")
deterministic_tree(man_children = c(3,2,3), title = "man_children = c(3,2,3)")
# Having "man_children" length =/= "splits" changes "splits" to length.
deterministic_tree(man_children = 4, title = "man_children = 4")
deterministic_tree(man_children = c(3,3,3,3,3), title = "man_children = c(3,3,3,3,3)")
```

#### The role of tapering and scaling at each split for "splits = 5"
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,3), mar=c(1,1,1,1))
deterministic_tree(splits = 5, title = "all = T")
deterministic_tree(splits = 5, taper = F, title = "scale_thickness = T, taper = F")
deterministic_tree(splits = 5, scale_thickness = F, taper = F, title = "scale_thickness = F, taper = F")
deterministic_tree(splits = 5, scale_length = F, title = "scale_length = F")
deterministic_tree(splits = 5, scale_angle = F, title = "scale_angle = F")
```

#### Explore "sib_lgth_ratio" which determines relative length of children at each split
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,3), mar=c(1,1,1,1))
deterministic_tree(splits = 8, sib_lgth_ratio = c(1,2), title = "splits = 8, sib_ratio = c(1,2)")
deterministic_tree(splits = 6, sib_lgth_ratio = c(1,2,1), title = "splits = 6, sib_ratio = c(1,2,1)")
deterministic_tree(splits = 5, sib_lgth_ratio = c(1,2,2,1), title = "splits = 5, sib_ratio = c(1,2,2,1)")
deterministic_tree(splits = 5, sib_lgth_ratio = c(2,1,1,2), title = "splits = 5, sib_ratio = c(1,2,2,1)")
deterministic_tree(splits = 6, sib_lgth_ratio = c(1,2,3), title = "splits = 6, sib_ratio = c(1,2,3)")
deterministic_tree(splits = 6, sib_lgth_ratio = c(2,1,2), title = "splits = 6, sib_ratio = c(1,2,3)")
```

#### Explore "trunk_scale". It simply shrinks the starter branch. Other arguments: "splits = 6, angle_scale = 1.25, sib_lgth_ratio = c(1,5,1)"
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,3), mar=c(1,1,1,1))
deterministic_tree(splits = 6, angle_scale = 1.25, sib_lgth_ratio = c(1,5,1), title = "default: trunk_scale = 1")
deterministic_tree(splits = 6, trunk_scale = 0.75, angle_scale = 1.25, sib_lgth_ratio = c(1,5,1), title = "trunk_scale = 0.75")
deterministic_tree(splits = 6, trunk_scale = 0.25, angle_scale = 1.25, sib_lgth_ratio = c(1,4,1), title = "trunk_scale = 0.25")
```

## The Nature of Code - Daniel Shiffman
Chapter 9 of Daniel Shiffman's <a hreg="https://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-8-fractals/">book</a> discusses fractals and random/deterministic trees. It was the main inspiration for this project, and part of my goal was to be able to casually reproduce some of the examples he provides. I do so below. 

#### Daniel's trees:

<img src="nature_of_code_examples_files/ch08_ex06b.png">
<img src="nature_of_code_examples_files/ch08_ex06c.png">

#### My trees:
```{r}
par(mfrow=c(1,3), mar=c(1,1,1,1))
deterministic_tree(splits = 8, children = 2, angle = 9*pi/12, scale_angle = F, 
                          scale_thickness = F, taper = F, thickness = 0.5, length_scale = 1.5)
deterministic_tree(splits = 8, children = 2, angle = pi/4, scale_angle = F, 
                          scale_thickness = F, taper = F, thickness = 0.5, length_scale = 1.5)
deterministic_tree(splits = 8, children = 2, angle = pi/20, scale_angle = F, 
                          scale_thickness = F, taper = F, thickness = 0.5, length_scale = 1.5)
```

## Random Trees

Essentially the same as <code>deterministic_trees()</code> but adds a few additional arguments.

<pre><code>
<b>random_angles</b>             : (lgl) Toggles angle noise on/off. Random values currently chosen 
                             via sampling from normal distribution.
<b>angle_variance</b>            : (dbl) Indicates base variance for angle noise. By default "set" to 
                                 zero be given value based on other inputs. In particular by (angles[2]/4)^2, 
                             where angles[2] is the angle between branches at the first split.
<b>random_lengths</b>            : (lgl) Toggles length noise on/off. Random values currently chosen via 
                             sampling from normal distribution.
<b>length_variance</b>           : (dbl) Indicates base variance for length noise. By default "set" to 
                              zero be given value later based on other inputs. In particular by lengths[1]/24, 
                             where lengths[1] is the length of the starting branch.
</code></pre>

The effects look admittedly better for some tree specifications than others.

```{r}
titles <- rep(c("both = F", "random_angles = T", "random_lengths = T", "both = T"), each = 4)
ras <- rep(c(F,F,F,F,T,T,T,T), 2)
rls <- c(rep(F,8),rep(T,8))
```

#### splits = 8, children = 2, angle = pi/4, scale_angle = F, length_scale = 1.4
```{r, fig.height = 5}
par(mfrow=c(4,4), mar=c(1,1,1,1))
for(i in 1:16){
  random_tree(splits = 8, children = 2, angle = pi/4, scale_angle = F, length_scale = 1.4, random_angles = ras[i], random_lengths = rls[i], title = titles[i])
}
```

#### splits = 6, trunk_scale = 0.75, angle_scale = 1.25, sib_ratio = c(1,3,1)
```{r, fig.height = 5}
par(mfrow=c(4,4), mar=c(1,1,1,1))
for(i in 1:16){
  random_tree(splits = 6, trunk_scale = 0.5, angle_scale = 1.25, sib_lgth_ratio = c(1,3,1), random_angles = ras[i], random_lengths = rls[i], title = titles[i])
}
```

## Animating Trees

Both functions above allow the user to store the output data of the tree for potential later modification. The function <code>swaying_tree()</code> takes this data dump as an input with a couple randomness variables to simulate wind patterns in the form of a random field of to create a GIF of a "swaying" tree. The images for the GIF file are stored locally before being deleted upon GIF formation.

```{r, message = F, warning = F}
fractal_tree <- random_tree(splits = 8, children = 2, angle = pi/4, scale_angle = F, random_angles = T, 
                            random_lengths = T, length_scale = 1.4, plot = F, datadump = T)
```

This code lives in the function <code>swaying_tree()</code>, with exception of the plotting.
```{r}
model <- RandomFields::RMexp(var = 0.02, scale = 0.4)
branch_count <- sum(cumprod(fractal_tree$fun_variables$children)) + 1
x <- seq(0, 10, length.out = 100)
y <- seq(0, 10, length.out = branch_count)
simu <- suppressMessages(as.matrix(RandomFields::RFsimulate(model, x, y, grid=TRUE)))

raster::plot(raster::raster(simu))
```

An example input and possible GIF.
```{r}
filename <- swaying_tree(fractal_tree, var = 0.02, scale = 0.4, return_filename = T)
```
