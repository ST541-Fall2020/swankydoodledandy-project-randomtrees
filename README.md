# Random Trees
#### Name: Sean Gilligan

This project is a "package" that contains functions for making fractal trees in R, starting with deterministic methods and introducing randomness to angles and lengths. 

The link below leads to a no-longer up-to-date discussion and demonstration of some of the functionality.<br>
