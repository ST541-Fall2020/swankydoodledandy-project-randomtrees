# Random Trees
#### Name: Sean Gilligan

This project demonstrates some basic techniques for making trees in R, starting with deterministic methods and introducing randomness. This project goes on to explore some artistic and possible practical applications of stochastic trees and L-systems in a hopefully pedagogically informed manner.
