# Random Trees
#### Name: Sean Gilligan

This project is a "package" that contains functions for making fractal trees in R, starting with deterministic methods and introducing randomness to angles and lengths. It also included functions for animating fractal trees.

The link below leads to a no-longer up-to-date discussion and demonstration of some of the functionality.<br>
