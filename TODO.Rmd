## Preliminary Work

* [x] Find way to draw customizable line segments in R.
* [ ] Write recursive function that systematically creates and connects lines segments.
* [ ] Explore functions until able to consistently and quickly approximate trees of example 8.6 in "Nature of Code". Complete development of `basic_deterministic_trees.Rmd`.
* [ ] Apply randomizations. Create some reproducible examples. Complete development of `basic_stochastic_trees.Rmd`.
* [ ] Read and understand section 8.6 L-systems, from "Nature of Code".
