## Preliminary Work

  - \[ \] Find way to draw customizable line segments in R.
  - \[ \] Write recursive function that systematically creates and
    connects lines segments.
  - \[ \] Explore functions until able to consistently and quickly
    approximate trees of example 8.6 in “Nature of Code”. Complete
    development of `basic_deterministic_trees.Rmd`.
  - \[ \] Apply randomizations. Create some reproducible examples.
    Complete development of `basic_stochastic_trees.Rmd`.
  - \[ \] Read and understand section 8.6 L-systems, from “Nature of
    Code”.
